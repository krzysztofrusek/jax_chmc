# jax_chmc
An implementation of a family of MCMC methods on implicitly defined manifolds


The api is similar to the one from [blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) but is slightly simplified, and closer to the original MATLAB [implementation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbrubake/projects/cmcmc/) by @mbrubake .


#### Project Status

__jax_chmc__ is still in its early phase. We are actively improving various software components. 
It is still quite far from ready for everyday use and is made
available without any support at the moment.

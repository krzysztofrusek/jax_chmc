# jax_chmc
An implementation of a family of MCMC methods on implicitly defined manifolds

This follows the matlab implementation from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbrubake/projects/cmcmc/

#### Project Status

__jax_chmc__ is still in its early phase. We are actively improving various software components. 
It is still quite far from ready for everyday use and is made
available without any support at the moment.
